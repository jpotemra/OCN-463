    "Now we can start to put things together in a simple script.  Much like Matlab, we simply enter the python commands into a file, then run that file.  Thus far we’ve entered commands one by one into the python interpreter.  A more common way to run python commands is to include them into a file, then “run” that file.  This helps preserve code but also provides efficiencies (e.g., if you make a mistake you don’t have to go back to the start and enter all the commands again).  Typically, python scripts end with the suffix .py.  \n",

In python this is done with a hash (#), and it can occur anywhere in the line (everything after, and including, the hash sign is ignored by the interpreter).  Multi-line comments can be enabled by starting with three single quotes (‘’’) and then ending the comment block with another three quotes.\n",
