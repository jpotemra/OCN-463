    "## Introduction, background, basics\n",
    "Python is an interpretive language (unlike, for example, Fortran that is a compiled language).  Scripts or code can be written in a text editor and then run via python, or commands can be entered interactively via the command line.  There are different versions of python, specifically python-2.7 and python-3 that present some important changes.  In addition, there are development (e.g., idle), interactive (e.g., ipython, jupyter) and GUI based (e.g., spyder) tools that can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will just cover some basics needed to work with data and make some straightforward plots.  One of the most important things to understand in python is that indentation is extremely important.  Most compiled languages make use of code blocks contained between beginning and ending statements, for example, “if” and “endif”, “subroutine” and “return”, “do” and “continue”, and so on.  In python, blocks are delineated by indenting the code within that block (same column).  For example, an “if” statement is not ended by an “endif” but rather by the line of code that lines up in the same column as the “if” statement itself.  We will go through several examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to keep in mind is since python is an interpretive language, function definitions have to come first in a script, before they are called, otherwise an undefined error will occur.  Compiled programs, on the other hand, can have subroutines defined at the beginning or end of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, while python has several “built-in” features or commands, to keep it lightweight almost all of the functions are kept externally.  These are brought into a script when needed.  For example, the package (library) NumPy (numpy) contains many useful functions.  These are not loaded in by default, instead they need to be loaded (imported) explicitly."

    "We will first start with an interactive python-3 session by entering “python3” at the terminal command prompt.  Note that python3 will need to be in your path for this to work (see Section x.x).  The terminal should respond with the display prompt “>>>” at which you can enter commands.  Here in jupyter notebook we won't see that however."

As noted, and note again here that in python, the list elements are counted from 0, so the first number in a list is referenced as the 0th.  A range in a list is obtained using a colon, A[start:end].  Again, to make it a little more confusing, the elements are referenced up to but not including the last, so while A[2:6] seems to reference elements 2 through six in list A, it really means the 3rd (since it starts counting at zero) to the 5th (since it doesn’t include the last one).  An optional “increment” can also be included, A[start:end:increment].  Finally, defaults are the first and last elements in a list, and are obtained if no number is given, e.g., A[::2] means start at 0, go to the end, increment by two.  Negative numbers can be used to go in the opposite “direction”.  Here are some examples:"
