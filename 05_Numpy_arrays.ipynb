    "\n",
    "which is a list of two lists which represent the rows of the matrix.  You can use slicing and comprehensions on multi-dimensional arrays but they don't always work as you might hope.  For example, how could you extract a sub-matrix? The obvious answer is to use slicing.  Given the 3x3 array:\n",
    "\n",
    "myArray=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]\n",
    "\n",
    "you might imagine that you could extract the 2x2 matrix in its top right-hand corner using:\n",
    "\n",
    "myArray[0:2][0:2]\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this doesn't work and what you get is:\n",

    "If you think about it this is perfectly reasonable. The first slicer specifies the first two elements of the list, and these are the first two rows, i.e. \n",

    "is \n",
    "\n",
    "[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can see what goes wrong with the second slicer - it isn't operating on the rows it is stil operating on the outer list. So it returns [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] [0:2] which is just the first two rows again.  Slicing notation works perfectly and as advertised, but it is common to think that it will do more.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to extract the sub-matrix then the simplest way is to use a list comprehension or the equivalent for loops:\n",

    "Note in the above, that the NumPy array goes well beyond what a standard Python array supports in terms of indexing.  The first big difference is that you can use a tuple as an indexing object.  The simplest case of this is to use a tuple of integers.  For example, in\n",

    "\n",
    "Both index methods work with NumPy arrays.  Being able to use a tuple of integers is a simplification of notation but you can go one step further and use a tuple of slicers.  The rule is that each slicer operates on its corresponding dimension. That is unlike the Python array where multiple slicers operate on the result of previous slicers the NumPy array implements things are you might want them to work, i.e., slicing each dimension in turn.  For example, if you now try:\n",
    "\n",
    "myArray[0:2,0:2]\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "array([[1, 2],[4, 5]])\n",
    "\n",
    "This works with any number of dimensions and each slicer is applied to the corresponding dimension to extract a sub-matrix. You can even use a step size to extract, say, every other row and column.  All you have to remember is to specify the slicers as part of a tuple and not as individual index terms.  Notice that if you don't specify one slicer for each dimension, the missing slicers are assumed to be :, i.e., the entire dimension. For example myArray[0:2] is taken to mean myArray[0:2,:].\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the ellipsis object to add : slicers if you want to specify slicers from the other end of the dimensions.  For example if bigArray has five dimensions, bigArray[...,0] specifies all of the rows columns and so on but with the final dimension set to index 0, i.e., it is equivalent to bigArray[:,:,:,:,0].  Also notice that myArray[0,:] is array([1, 2, 3]), i.e., row zero all column entries as a one dimensional array, but myArray[0:1,:] is array([[1, 2, 3]]), i.e., a two dimensional array consisting of just row zero.  In general using an integer i returns an array with one less dimension than using the slicer [i:i+1] which returns the same elements. \n",

You can use this technique to access arbitrary sub matrices of elements or regular sub matrices with indexes determined by other matrices.  There are lots of rules that govern how the lists of integers are applied, i.e., what happens if you don't specify enough lists and so on but they are all obvious defaults. \n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean indexing is another indexing method borrowed from Matlab and Octave.  You can use a Boolean array to pick out the elements you want to work with.  If the Boolean array has a true element then the element in the array being indexed is selected.  Now at first thought this doesn't sound like a very useful option.  Why would you go to the trouble of constructing a Boolean array to pick elements from an array?  The answer is because it is very easy.\n",
